## Recomended Software
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
    - any java capable IDE would work, but Eclipse and WindowBuilder is a nice combination
- [Window Builder](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/windowbuilder) (Eclipse Plugin)
    - can also be installed using the Eclipse Marketplace
- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/de-de/download)
    - preferably with a few log files that were created while playing on Hypixel SkyBlock

## Getting Started
1. Log into github
2. Fork this repository
3. Clone the project to your local machine 
    - git command, Android Studio or some GUI (I for example used SourceTree)
4. Import the projekt into Eclipse
5. (Wait for the project to fully load)
6. Now you can change files and test the application
7. Once you are you are happy with your result you can commit and push everything to a **new branch** of your forked project
8. If you want to create a pull request you can do that on the github page of your forked project
    - github automatically offers you that option once you've made changes to your forked project
